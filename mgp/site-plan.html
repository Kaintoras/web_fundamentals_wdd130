        It is a fact that womeswear fashion in the western world is not assosiated with modesty. At first that was something that only happened with streetwear. But as time passses by this idea of fashion has extended to other areas of the fahsion industry.
        When a girl tries to find a modest wedding dress nowadays they might find a couple of plain designs or dresses that have been altered to be modest. We think every bride deserves to have the "say yes to the dress" experience, no matter what kind of dress they choose. 
        Have a look at the selections of dresses we have or design your own dress with me!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a fashion designer born in Venezuela. I studied fashion in Madrid and London and soon after graduating I started working in the bridal industry. That was the moment I realised how much some girls struggle to find a dress they love and feel comfortable wearing.
        I decided then that I wanted to make it my life goal to create a brand of bridal dresses that were modest AND would still be modern, chic, sexy, or wathever a girl wanted for her own dress!
