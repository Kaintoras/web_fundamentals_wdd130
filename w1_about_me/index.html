    <h2>Joseph Javier García Hernández</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Joseph and I don't have a nickname.<br>
        I'm 36 years old and happily married to a wonderful woman
         named Manuela that I met 5 years ago in one of my adventures.</p>
    
    <p>I've been an LDS member since my mother met the church in 1989 and now I'm working with my stake as calling.</p>
    
    <p>My hobbies are video games, JDM and classic cars, sports, wargames, books, music, and travel around the world.<br> 
        I have to blame my dad because he was the one that hooked me into games when I was a child. We use to spend the 
        nights playing with an Atari 2600 and since that, I grow up playing a lot of different titles. </p>
